                                Macbease is a platform that allows clubs, communities, and event organizers to list
                                and promote their events. While we provide the tools and technology to facilitate
                                event management and ticket sales, we do not have direct control over the execution of
                                these events. Therefore, it is crucial for event organizers, clubs, and communities to
                                take full responsibility for the planning, execution, and management of their events.

                            <p class="fs-6">We strongly encourage all users of the Macbease platform, including
                                attendees, to exercise due diligence when participating in events. We recommend verifying the
                                credibility and reputation of event organizers, clubs, and communities hosting events. While we
                                make efforts to ensure the legitimacy of users on our platform, we cannot guarantee the

                                communities. The terms and conditions of ticket sales, including pricing, refunds, and cancellation
                                policies, are determined by the event organizers or the respective clubs/communities. Attendees
                                should review these terms and conditions before purchasing tickets and understand that
                                Macbease does not control or influence these policies.</p>

                                Macbease cannot guarantee the safety of attendees at events. It is the responsibility of
                                event organizers, clubs, and communities to implement appropriate safety measures and comply with
                                local laws and regulations. Attendees should be aware of their surroundings and exercise
                                caution when attending events.</p>

                                encourage them to report these incidents to the event organizers or the appropriate authorities, as
                                necessary. Macbease may cooperate with law enforcement and relevant authorities in case of any
                                legal investigations or inquiries.</p>

                            <p class="fs-6">Macbease is committed to continuously improving our platform's safety
                                and security features. We encourage users to provide feedback and report any suspicious or
                                harmful activity on our platform. We take such reports seriously and will take appropriate
                                actions when necessary.

                        enjoyable event experiences, we want to emphasize that event organizers, clubs, and communities
                        bear the primary responsibility for the events they host. Attendees are encouraged to exercise caution,
                        verify event details, and communicate directly with event organizers or clubs/communities if
                        they have any questions or concerns. We appreciate your trust in Macbease as a platform for discovering
                        and participating in events. Our commitment to safety and transparency is unwavering, and we will continue to work
                        diligently to provide a secure and reliable platform for our users.
